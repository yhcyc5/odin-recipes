	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>Channel your inner mixologist with infused vodka and homemade sour mix, then shake them together for a sweet-tart sipper you can call your own.</p>

	<h2>Ingredients</h2>
	<ul>
        <li>Pineapple-Basil Vodka</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups chopped fresh pineapple</li>
        <li>1 (750-ml) bottle vodka</li>
        <li>1/2 cup fresh basil leaves, plus more for garnish</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Steps</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>For pineapple-basil vodka, put pineapple in a 1-quart jar. Top with vodka, cover, and let stand until vodka is infused with pineapple flavor, 1 to 3 days. Add basil, cover, and infuse for 1 to 2 hours; strain. <br>
            Meanwhile for the DIY sour mix, combine sugar and water in a saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat, stirring until sugar is dissolved. Remove from heat; let cool. Add lime juice and lemon juice. Chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour and up to 1 week.</li>
		<li>In a pitcher, stir together pineapple-basil vodka and DIY sour mix. Serve in rocks glasses over ice. Top with club soda (if using); garnish with pineapple wedges, fronds, and additional basil.</li>

	</ol>
